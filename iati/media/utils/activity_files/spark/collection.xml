<description type="1" xml:lang="en">Project Goal(s):

- Support entrepreneurship and SME development in isolated regions and among
marginalized group (youth and women) through trainings

- Extend support to starting entrepreneurs as well as existing SMEs through Loan scheme of
UEC partners BSCK and BAC Zvecan &#8211; direct impact to poverty reduction.
The idea of Loan scheme is to provide good Loan conditions (low installment rate) to
SME&#8217;s. As one of the criteria for using Loan scheme we can request from SME&#8217;s to
employ new staff. Also loans could be used only for start-up of business, expend of
production or market. According to experience of other organizations in region that
provided this kind of loan schemes, repayment rate was between 70-80%. This repayment
rate was in 2006 (IOM SEDMIN repayment rate), at that moment still judiciary institutions
were not functioned in full capacities. Information that we received today from FINCA
(Strpce office) saying that current repayment rate is 95%. They have only 5 not repaying
cases on the court. This shows improvement of awareness of entrepreneurs and citizens in
general. According to this information and BAC Zvecan and BSCK experience repayment
rate will be high even more then 90%.

- Identify barriers to doing business for the entrepreneurs and SMEs, leading to a (more)
enabling environment for private sector development.</description>
<description type="2" xml:lang="en">- Established Fractal office within RED office in Strpce, with 2 new employees

- 3 Fractal staff trained for business advising and coaching, being able to efficiently and
effectively serve beneficiaries in targeted locations. Fractal will organize transparent
procedure for hiring personal for this position, our attention is to hire staff that already
had experience in this field, however they will need more capacity building trainings

- The successful result will be if 80% of our beneficiaries&#8217; evaluate services that project will
provide to them as satisfactory. Other tangible result will if 76% of beneficiaries are from
marginalized group and isolated locations.</description>

<description type="1" xml:lang="en">Project Goal(s):

&#8226; To create an (extra-curricular) income generating, entrepreneurial opportunity for target group
&#8226; To provide the target group with improved future perspectives (and reduce their, currently
widely felt, dissatisfaction with society)
&#8226; To create a cultural venue and meeting place with a public function
&#8226; To enhance employment and employability of target group
&#8226; To raise entrepreneurial spirit amongst target group</description>
<description type="2" xml:lang="en">Project Results:

&#8226; Start-up two cultural enterprises: one in North-Mitrovica and one in South-Mitrovica
&#8226; Social participation and inclination of youth and post-graduates</description>
<description type="3" xml:lang="en">The project targets students and post graduates in North and South Mitrovica, since the program cannot escape the overwhelming demographic majority of Kosovo today falling into the 18-35 age range (over 55%).

Currently, students have difficulties finding additional work during their studies with the consequence that graduates lack working experience and the corresponding skills. KM empowers the target audience through skills proficiency, improvement of their employability and/or strength to create new jobs. KM provide the target audience with extra-curricular activities to develop skills like communication, teamwork, management, cooperation, information and communication technologies or organisational skills.</description>

<title xml:lang="en">Development of a  business incubator in a rural environment</title>
<description type="1" xml:lang="en">Project Goals: 

Overall Objectives: 
To build the capacity of COPED staff in the areas of rural business incubation. 

Specific ojbectives: 
Train staff on creating and managing a rural business incubator 
Prepare a location/facilities for the incubator including management and operations procedures for the incubator

Project Strategy: 

S1: Capacity building

Business creation in rural areas has to face many constraints, lack of motivation, small markets, human resources poorly trained. It is this element that must be, we believe, based on our strategy. Entrepreneurs exist (latent or overt) but you need to guide them on their way to the creation and or enhancement of their business for business. 

To increase the value added of the project staff and sustainability of the action, we believe that in a first time, experts will train COPED staff in the business of business creation. These will consolidate and further replicate this knowledge for future entrepreneurs (clients) in 2012. 

S2: Prepare to set up an incubator to help entrepreneurs 

In the world most businesses fail within the first year for lack of know how, markets, capital, lack of support in general (common services). This is why we want to prepare ourselves to offer incubation space and job coaching (coaching). We believe that this support will encourage pro-business job creation to these companies.

<title xml:lang="en">Bridging the divide</title>
<description type="1" xml:lang="en">Overall objective
Stabilize and reintegrate the community by seeking to bridge divisions through highly visible
infrastructural upgrades, CSO empowerment, and maturing media, open youth work and the sustainable development of local and institutional and civil interethnic-cooperation and communication, thus facilitating the depolarization and the reduction of ethnic tensions while enhancing security, stability and reintegration.

Project Goal
Community stabilization through targeted infrastructural interventions, CSO empowerment,
maturing media, open youth work, and the sustainable development of local institutional and civil interethnic cooperation in Mitrovica.
</description>
<description type="2" xml:lang="en">Project results

10-15 highly visible and needed, high-impact, infrastructural upgrades on both sides of Mitrovica, effectively implemented fast while directly including institutions from both sides in the process, with an indicative limit of approximately 50.000 Euro per project and in total making up for half the presently requested overall budget, i.e. 500.000 Euro.

Initial steps towards rapprochement by having a multi-ethnic board coordinate these interventions, thus facilitating a rudimentary cooperation between municipal and civil representatives from both sides.

A sustainable interethnic, bilingual, objective, investigative and professional monthly webzine called M-M@G that critically but constructively reports on locally relevant issues and provides objective, solution-oriented information geared towards bridging the divide, not underlining it.

A popular, continuously updated, interethnic, bilingual Youth Portal (Mi:2), closely connected to the radio station Kontakt Plus and the Centre for Resources, Youth and Media (CRYM), that focuses on issues relevant to especially the youth of Mitrovica with an eye to informing, activating and empowering them, while opening up a channel to support and publish aspiring young journalists.

A high quality and selling printed quarterly magazine compiling the most relevant articles from the webzines and portal, working closely together with the new Mitrovica Media Centre to be established within CRYM.

An ethnically mixed editorial team that produces relevant investigative and social journalism and effectively takes up the role of a local watchdog that holds local, national and international institutions and agencies active in Mitrovica accountable.

An effective educational structure within the M-M@G wherein aspiring young journalists are encouraged, educated, supported and tutored by elderly members of the editorial team and successfully run the youth portal Mi:2.

A high quality, relevant and recognizable multi-medium that will prove itself sustainable in the midterm by proving to be of clear interest to potential subscribers, donors and authorities, while attracting a sizable audience that will allow it to generate considerable revenues from over-the-counter sales and advertisements

A powerful communication medium that strengthens active citizenship and serves as a bridge for existing and new initiatives coming from both sides of the Iber, while effectively communicating the rationale and results of the Bridging the Divide project as a whole, and strongly linking its various components.

The establishment of a vibrant new Centre for Resources, Youth and Media (CRYM) that facilitates the integration of a fragmented NGO community towards a strong, active, resource-pooling, synergetic and accountable local civil society; provides a platform for citizen participation and forms a breeding ground for new grassroots initiatives by supporting local CSOs in capacity building, cooperation and outreach across the divide, while providing a newly-formed coalition of local CSOs with adequate premises that
strengthen their stability, capacities and joint impact.

The separate establishment of a progressively multi-ethnic open youth centre within CRYM that includes a rock school, youth club and informal educational, cultural and integration programs that attract significant numbers of children and youth from initially- especially the North, while opening up a concrete channel to direct the synergetic energy available from the coalescing of forces by the 7 organizations within CRYM that will run it.
</description>
<description type="3" xml:lang="en">Target Group

Municipal Infrastructural Upgrades  it is estimated that app. 25,000 citizens of Mitrovica South
and app. 15,000 citizens of North Mitrovica will have direct benefits from the a. newly constructed, b. reconstructed and c. upgraded municipal infrastructural capacities (Direct Beneficiaries), while the overall quality of life of the overall estimated population of Mitrovica South (90,000 citizens) and North Mitrovica (20,000 citizens) will significantly and visibly benefit(Indirect Beneficiaries).

M-M@G/Mi:2  the fresh and online M-M@G expects to reach approximately 3,000 Mitrovica
(North and South) readers upon the projects start ( M-M@Gs primary direct target group consists of readers ages 25 to 40). Because of the online availability of the magazine M-M@G expects this number to increase drastically over the project period, with an optimal local reach of approximately 6,000 readers per month.1 Besides its readers, Mi:2s direct beneficiaries include the youth contributing to the online publication, who will receive journalistic training. This group consists of approximately 20 to 30 young writers over the project period.

</description>
<description type="2" xml:lang="en">Project outputs: 
These activities will result in:

2 training opportunities within the year and if possible provide on the job training on specific topics.
 At least 2 new services to STIKK membership
For the first year, at least 6 start-ups with innovative ideas will receive loans. This is particularly important knowing that Kosovo has limited sources of finance and that the only sources of financing currently include bank loans at very high interest rates. The loans to be provided under the project will be at affordable conditions for businesses. Venture Capital Sources: The project staff will create relationships with a range of equity finance sources (i.e. business angels and venture capital) domestically or internationallywho may have an interest in either receiving financing proposals or playing an active role in coaching and financing high potential projects. The longer term aim would be to develop a formal business angel/venture capital network focusing on innovation.
The Business Tuesday event will be held every first Tuesday of the month. There will be 12 events of this kind organized during the entire year. The event will serve as an arena for incubator companies, investors and international businesses.
Three startup businesses with innovative ideas will have the opportunity to participate in innovation fairs. This will provide the opportunity for startups, students with innovative ideas and companies to share examples of their products, approaches or practices and to disseminate them more widely. The participants cost share will be preparation of their promotion material. 
Within the Innovation Centre, coaching and mentoring will be part of the assistance for start ups and small businesses. Using existing STIKK database of consultants, ICK will engage qualified individuals with the purpose of advising and mentoring innovators and entrepreneurs through the business side to developing and commercializing an innovative project. This activity will be supported by Norwegian financial contribution.
Development of at least one policy paper on improvement of business environment. This activity will serve all businesses (including the ones from North Mitrovica, who are registered and are operating in accordance with Kosovo legislation). 
At least one regional ICT event

Project outcomes:
These outputs will lead to:

Participation in trainings/and on the job training opportunities. This has been very productive in the past, however given the young age of staff, further professional development opportunities are needed as to enhance capacity building and increase the overall performance.
Members would feel more satisfied with the services provided by the association, thus helping the association maintain its current members, but also gain new members. This would at the same time improve the financial stability of the association and the overall sustainability. 
Beneficiaries will be able to expand their businesses by implementing new business ideas, and by introducing new products. At the same time, eventual expansion of the businesses will help create new jobs, but also enable the Kosovo companies to develop their business process outsourcing opportunities.
The aim of the Business Tuesday is to match ideas with the potential investors. Creation of a widespread practice for the businesses to enhance business dialogue. Within the Business Tuesday event we intend to contribute to achieving the following aims:
- The internationalization of the domestic business
- Continuity of attracting investments into innovative businesses
Participation in innovation fairs-This is particularly significant knowing that Kosovo lacks events in which young creative people could present their innovative ideas. Promotion of their ideas would also help them further develop these ideas by finding potential investors or donors who would be ready to support them. Their cost share will cover the promotion material for a fair.
Start ups located in the incubator of the Innovation Centre will benefit from the experience of the assistant team composed from experienced professionals within the ICT sector. They will be receiving coaching and mentoring sessions which is a necessary tool in achieving the best results.
Based on the &#8220;Kosovo Business Agenda&#8221;, a survey conducted by American Chamber of Commerce in Kosovo (STIKK was one of the main stakeholders in this survey), most important issues will be identified and a policy paper will be drafted on that particular issue o or group of issues, by making a detailed analysis, rendering conclusions and recommendations. This policy paper will then be addressed to the relevant institutions.
The project will also include at least one regional ICT event, which will enable sharing the experience, best practices and know how between the regional counterparts.
